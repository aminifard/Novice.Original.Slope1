Novice.Original.Slope1 code has been associated to find optimal solution of the a compressed sensing problem with bounded variables as follows:
min ||SV||+mu||v||_1
s.t. l_1<v<u_1.
To run the program, you may run driver_cs file. To do so:    
please enter your file name, your sheet and your data range for matrix S on lines 11-13.
please enter  your data range for lower bound vector l_1 on the line 24.
please enter  your data range for lower bound vector u_1 on the line 31.
